learn gradle
clean things up
logging
write tests
handle remote shutdown properly (it doesn't seem to actually work)
finish the FrameHandler framework
work with remotes that can run multiple threads to process faster
find a better way to handle the actual writing of modules & reduce the required size of the modules
check for module on disk as well before remote fetching (and update command which doesn't do this)
lifecycle control commands
look at the interface for non-commandline users
write spinup script
deploy to a pi
multiple pis, if desirable
look into making a web interface for it from site
is it possible to write as an executor service (ie just some abstract thing that takes in a list of callables and does them)?
would probably need to package the relevant code at runtime, deploy to site, setup a pool, launch several workers, install the code to them,
and then begin running as a normal service, might be impossible
clean things up again
write more tests

clean things up again
write more tests

:P

write the relevant CIV19 module, and move back to working on CIV19
