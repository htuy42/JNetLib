a | is half an x!
and 2 of them is a note!

[x]learn gradle
[x]clean things up
[x]logging
[|]write tests
[x]heartbeat handler
[x]handle remote shutdown properly tentatively yes, but look for future issues
[x]finish the FrameHandler framework
[x]work with remotes that can run multiple threads to process faster
[ ]find a better way to handle the actual writing of modules & reduce the required size of the modules || this seems best held until I actually start writing some modules and see what I want
[x]check for module on disk as well before remote fetching (and update command which doesn't do this)
[x]lifecycle control commands
[x]move stuff to plain lambdas where applicable
[x]look at the interface for non-commandline users || seems good :)
[x]make handshake, heartbeat, and frame part of some concept of a protocol, which can be installed into both a server and a client || I actually undid this. It wound up being a mess.
[ ]logging is currently insufficient
[ ]write spinup script
[ ]deploy to a pi
[ ]multiple pis, if desirable
[ ]look into making a web interface for it from site
[ ]is it possible to write as an executor service (ie just some abstract thing that takes in a list of callables and does them)?
would probably need to package the relevant code at runtime, deploy to site, setup a pool, launch several workers, install the code to them,
and then begin running as a normal service, might be impossible
[ ]clean things up again
[ ]write more tests

:P

write the relevant CIV19 module, and move back to working on CIV19
